### Summary of the Problem, Attempts, Solution, and Explanation

## The Original Problem
Your React frontend was not communicating properly with your Express backend, leading to CORS errors in the browser. Additionally, issues with the nginx configuration, environment variables, and production build settings contributed to the problem.

## What We Tried En Route to the Solution

### Nginx Config Check:
- We checked Nginx's proxy_pass directive for API requests and ensured it pointed to the correct backend (http://localhost:3000/).

### Backend Status:
- Verified the Node.js server was running on port 3000.
- Checked whether the backend was returning proper responses by using curl.

### Environment Variables:
- Reviewed the .env files for production and development to ensure REACT_APP_API_URL pointed to the correct backend endpoint.
- Ensured the .env.production file was in the right place and picked up during the frontend build process.

### Rebuilt the Frontend:
- Regenerated the production build for the React app using npm run build.
- Verified the index.html and static files included the correct API URL.

### Caching Issues:
- Cleared Nginx's cache and ensured index.html was served without caching.


### CORS Middleware:
- Ensured cors middleware was being used in your Express server and configured properly for the frontend origin.

### Permissions Issues:
- Fixed file and folder permissions for the build directory so Nginx could serve the correct index.html and static files.

## What Finally Resolved the Issue

### Updated the Nginx Config for CORS
- Added the following in the Nginx config to explicitly allow requests from the React frontend origin:

``
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "http://165.232.159.43"; # Replace with frontend URL
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS";
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Content-Type, Authorization";
add_header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials "true";
``

### Rebuilt the React Production Build:
- Made sure the correct API URL (http://165.232.159.43/api) was set in .env.production and used during the React build process.

### Restarted Nginx and the Backend:
- Reloaded Nginx with: ``sudo systemctl reload nginx``

### Ensured the backend was running on localhost:3000 with:
``ps aux | grep node``

## Why It Worked
- CORS Configuration: The CORS error occurred because the backend was not explicitly allowing requests from the frontend origin (http://165.232.159.43). Adding Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers in Nginx allowed cross-origin requests.
- Correct API URL: Setting the correct REACT_APP_API_URL in .env.production ensured the frontend sent API requests to the backend running behind Nginx.
- Nginx Proxy Pass: Nginx was successfully proxying /api/ requests to the backend server (http://localhost:3000/).
- Fresh Build: Rebuilding the React app ensured the latest configuration and API URL were included in the production files.
- Permissions: Fixing permissions allowed Nginx to access the React build files and serve the correct index.html and static assets.

## Key Learnings
- Ensure the correct environment variables (.env.production) are set during the React build process.
- Use Nginx for CORS configuration when proxying requests to the backend.
- Verify file permissions for Nginx to access and serve static files.
- Clear caches or restart services when making configuration changes.
- Test each part of the system (frontend, Nginx, backend) step by step.
